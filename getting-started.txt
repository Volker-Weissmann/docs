Getting started

Version 0.5.2 of the Java code generator can be downloaded {<{<a href='cellc-java.zip'>here</a>}>}. The C# code generator (version 0.5.3) is available in two versions: {<{<a href='cellc-cs-win.zip'>Windows-only</a>}>} and {<{<a href='cellc-cs.zip'>cross-platform</a>}>}. The cross-platform version requires .NET Core 3.1 or higher.

After you unzip the file, you'll see four directories: {{bin}}, {{stdlib}}, {{examples}} and {{sublime-text}}. The first one contains the compiler, the second one the standard library, and the third one a few ready-to-build examples to get you started. To create your own project, just pick one of them and start making changes to it. You can find more information about them in {{examples/README.txt}}. If you want a more complex example to play with, the IMDB example described {<{<a href='benchmarks-relational.html'>here</a>}>} is available on {<{<a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb'>github</a>}>}, and so is the introductory {<{<a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-online-forum'>example</a>}>}.

Each of the code generators produces, when the compilation process is successful, one or more source files in the target language. These files can then be fed directly to a compiler for the corresponding language if your Cell source code includes a {{Main(..)}} procedure, or otherwise included in an existing project.

There documentation for the standard library (which is really minimal at the moment) is available {<{<a href='standard-library.html'>here</a>}>}.

The {{sublime-text}} directory contains syntax highlighting files for Sublime Text. Just copy them in the {{~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User}} directory on Linux, or its equivalent in other operating systems.


Debugging

There's no debugger for Cell, and debugging is done mainly by tracing the execution of a program with the help of the {{print}} statement. Another useful tool is the {{assert}} statement. When an assertion fails, the execution of the program is stopped and all the variables in scope are printed to the standard output or to a file, if they are too large. If the program is running in debug mode (more on that in a second) the call stack is also printed, along with the value of all the arguments of all function calls on it. Call stack and values of function arguments are also printed every time the program crashes, for whatever reason (again, this happens only if the program is running in debug mode). Only a small part of this data is actually written to the standard output, with the rest of it being written to a set of files. All the files created by a program crash are created inside the {{debug}} subdirectory of the working directory of the process. This subdirectory is not created automatically: you have to create it manually before running the code, otherwise no dump file will be produced.

Sometimes there's no choice but to debug the generated code. The code itself is all but incomprehensible, but the names of variables and functions are the same as in the Cell sources, with the addition of a short suffix that is needed to avoid name clashes. For example a two-argument non-polymorphic function named {{my_fn(..)}} in Cell will be named {{my_fn_F2(..)}} in the generated code, and a variable named {{my_var}} will become {{my_var_V}}. How to print the value of a variable containing/pointing to a Cell object is language-specific, and is described in the following sections.


Java

The Java code generator is provided as a jar file, {{cellc-java.jar}}. To run it, just type {{java -jar cellc-java.jar <project file> <output directory>}}, assuming {{cellc-java.jar}} is in the current directory . The compiler will produce a {{Generated.java}} file containing the core logic, and a separate file for each of the public classes you'll be interacting with. Their interface is documented in pseudo-Java code in another generated file, {{interfaces.txt}}.

In order to compile your code in debug mode, and have it print a complete stack trace when an error occurs, you'll have to use the {{-d}} option of the compiler: {{java -jar cellc-java.jar -d <project file> <output directory>}}.

If you want to inspect the content of a variable containing a Cell object when debugging the generated code, just print the output of its {{toString()}} method.


C#

The C# code generator is provided as a Windows executable ({{cellc.exe}}) and also as cross-platform library ({{cellc-cs.dll}}). To use the cross-platform version you'll need to install .NET Core 3.1 or higher. The command to run the compiler is {{cellc.exe <project file> <output directory>}} on Windows, or {{dotnet cellc-cs.dll <project file> <output directory>}} for the cross-platform version. The compiler generates three different source files: {{generated.cs}}, {{runtime.cs}} and {{facades.cs}}. The first one contains the core generated code, the second the runtime libraries and the last one all the facade classes you'll be interacting with in your own C# code. Their interface is documented in pseudo-C# code in another generated file, {{interfaces.txt}}.

In order to compile your code in debug mode, and have it print a complete stack trace when an error occurs, you'll have to use the {{-d}} option of the compiler: {{cellc-cs.exe -d  <project file> <output directory>}}.

If you want to inspect the content of a variable containing a Cell object when debugging the generated code, just print the output of its {{ToString()}} method.
